# Configuration

The Query Engine has a lot of configurable parameters, many of which can be ignored by  most users.
There is only one parameter that must be configured for the query engine to start: the list of acceptable JWT issuers.

The full set of parameters is defined by the Parameters class, which can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/Yaytay/query-engine/blob/main/query-engine/src/main/java/uk/co/spudsoft/query/main/Parameters.java).
