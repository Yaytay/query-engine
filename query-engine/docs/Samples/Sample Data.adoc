= Sample Data

The sample database is completely meaningless and only exists to demonstrate some of the features of the Query Engine.

In addition to the tables, the load scripts also create a number of functions and/or procedures.
These are only used in the generation of the data for the sample tables.

Depending on configuration the sample database may also contain the link:../Audit.html[audit table].

The tables of the same database are:

== Colours

A simple lookup table containing colours.

[cols="1,1,3",stripes=even]
|===
|Name | Datatype | Description

|[[colourId]]colourId | Integer | Primary key
|name | String | The name of the colour from link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors[Wikipedia].
|hex | String | The hex value for the colour
|===

== RefData

A table of lookup values.

The primary key is a UUID (in the best representation that the database platform offers) and the value is a textualised number.

[cols="1,1,3",stripes=even]
|===
|Name | Datatype | Description

|refId | UUID | Primary key
|value | String | A number in words.
|===

== Data

The primary table of the set.

[cols="1,1,3",stripes=even]
|===
|Name | Datatype | Description

|dataId | Integer | Primary key
|colourId | Integer | A reference to the Colours table
|instant | Date/time | A date/time value
|value | String | Some text
|===

== Fields

The definitions of the dynamic fields in the dataset.

This table only contains 7 rows, each of which defines a dynamic field.

[cols="1,1,3",stripes=even]
|===
|Name | Datatype | Description

|fieldId | Integer | Primary key - ID for the field definition
|name | String | The name of the defined field.
|type | String | The type of the defined field.
|valueField | String | The name of the field in the FieldValues table that contains the actual values.
|===

== FieldValues

The source of the values for the dynamic fields.

[cols="1,1,3",stripes=even]
|===
|Name | Datatype | Description

|dataId | Integer | ID for row in the Data table to which this data belongs
|fieldId | Integer | ID for the field definition (in the Fields table)
|dateValue | Date | The value to use if the dynamic field is a Date
|timeValue | Time| The value to use if the dynamic field is a Time
|dateTimeValue | Date/Time | The value to use if the dynamic field is a Date and Time
|longValue | BigInt | The value to use if the dynamic field is a Long
|textValue | String| The value to use if the dynamic field is a String
|===

== ManyData

A many-to-many join table between Data and RefData.

[cols="1,1,3",stripes=even]
|===
|Name | Datatype | Description

|dataId | Integer | ID for row in the Data table to which this data belongs
|sort | Integer | Numerical value for sorting the data within each Data row
|refId | UUID | ID for the data in the RefData table
|ordering | Integer | A sort order column
|===

== DynamicEndpoint

The DynamicEndpoint table is orthogonal to the rest of the sample data
 - it contains data necessary for performing dynamic lookup of of databases.

[cols="1,1,3",stripes=even]
|===
|Name | Datatype | Description

|endpointKey | String | The name of the endpoint (primary key for the table)
|type | String | The type of endpoint represented (always 'SQL' in the sample data)
|url | String | The Vertx URL to the database
|urlTemplate | String | Always null in the sample data
|secret | String | Pre-configured secret containing credentials for accessing the endpoint, (always null in the sample data)
|username | String | Username to use for accessing the sample database
|password | String | Password to use for accessing the sample database
|useCondition | String | Condition that must be met for the endpoint to be used
|===
