= SessionConfig

Configuration of the session/login subsystem.

Sessions are not required by the REST API, but can be used if set up.
A session is effectively just a cookie that links to a JWT generated by the login handler.


Session data can be stored either in memory or in a database, depending on whether or not  is set.
