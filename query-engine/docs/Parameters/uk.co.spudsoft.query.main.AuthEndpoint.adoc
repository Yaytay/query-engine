= AuthEndpoint

Configuration data for OAuth authentication.

OAuth is only intended to be configured for the user interface when accessed directly, which is not the intended standard production deployment
 (where it is expected that the host will seamlessly provide a suitable JWT).
 

OAuth can be useful in design mode where there is no host platform but JWTs are required for testing conditions.
 

Each of the AuthEndpoints configured is presented as an option to the user when they attempt to login via the UI.
 Login may be optional (controlled by ) - if login is optional the user must explicitly choose to login.
 

The login mechanism is purely concerned with the generation of the JWT - the validation is still goverened by the xref:uk.co.spudsoft.query.main.JwtValidationConfig.adoc[JwtValidationConfig] .
 

The following properties are mandatory:
 
 * name
 * issuer
 


Authentication will follow the standard OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant, with or without PKCE and nonce.

| Name
| Type
| Details


| [[logoUrl]]logoUrl
| link:https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html[String]
| The URL to use to get a icon to display in the list of authentication endpoints in the login UI.

This is optional - if not provided no icon will be displayed.
| [[issuer]]issuer
| link:https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html[String]
| The issuer that JWTs created by this login will use.

The issuer provided must still be valid according to the xref:uk.co.spudsoft.query.main.JwtValidationConfig.adoc[JwtValidationConfig] , this is just used to identify the issuer 
 because the user is given a choice of login providers and the issuer cannot be extracted from the JWT.
| [[authorizationEndpoint]]authorizationEndpoint
| link:https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html[String]
| The OAuth authorization endpoint.
| [[tokenEndpoint]]tokenEndpoint
| link:https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html[String]
| The OAuth token endpoint.
| [[endSessionEndpoint]]endSessionEndpoint
| link:https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html[String]
| The endpoint to use for frontchannel logout.

The appropriate value is returned as "end_session_endpoint" in OpenID Discovery data.
 

When used, a request to the logout endpoint will result in a redirect to this URL with a query string parameter of 
 post_logout_redirect_uri set to the Query Engine start page.
 

This endpoint will not be used at all if backchannel logout works (via xref:uk.co.spudsoft.query.main.AuthEndpoint.adoc[#getRevocationEndpoint()] .
| [[revocationEndpoint]]revocationEndpoint
| link:https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html[String]
| The endpoint to use for backchannel logout.

The appropriate value is returned as "revocation_endpoint" in OpenID Discovery data.
 

When used, a request to the logout endpoint will make a request from the back end to this endpoint passing in 
 either the refresh_token (if one was provided) or the access_token.
 

Some OpenID providers require the "openid" scope to be specified in order for them to generate an id_token.
| [[credentials]]credentials
| xref:uk.co.spudsoft.query.main.ClientCredentials.adoc[ClientCredentials]
| The client credentials to use when communicating with the OAuth endpoint.
| [[scope]]scope
| link:https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html[String]
| The scope(s) to specify in the OAuth request.
| [[pkce]]pkce
| boolean
| True if the OAuth request will use PKCE.
| [[nonce]]nonce
| boolean
| True if the OAuth request will include (and validate) a nonce value.
| [[invalidDate]]invalidDate
| link:https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/time/LocalDateTime.html[LocalDateTime]
| The date at which this endpoint should be refreshed via link:https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html[OpenID Connect Discovery] .

This is not intended to be used for configuration, it is an internal value for implementation use.
